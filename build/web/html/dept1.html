                            <p>The Chemical Engineering Department is one of the premier engineering
                                departments of Banasthali University. It has a dynamic and goal oriented
                                group of faculty well supported by experienced technical staff. The
                                Department offers instructions at undergraduate level leading to a 4 year
                                B.Tech degree. The instruction at the undergraduate level aims at providing
                                the students a broad-based education with emphasis on theory and practice of
                                Chemical Engineering, keeping in views the current and future requirements 
                                of the country. Students are encouraged to identify industrial problems. 
                                In-plant training in industrial organizations is a part of the regular 
                                undergraduate curriculum. In addition to the infrastructural facilities, 
                                pilot plant sized equipment as well as advanced instruments are available. 
                                These serve the multiple purposes of training the undergraduate students as 
                                well as carrying out research work for final application to solve industrial 
                                problems.</p>
